Challenge
Use the planning strategy and process demonstrated above to design a parking lot. This is a common OOP interview question and the time you spend thoughtfully thinking through this problem will be helpful.

As you design your solution, and think through all of the necessary objects, attributes, methods, and relationships, keep the following in mind:

Payments
What methods are allowed?
Where do customers pay?
Capacity
How does the system respond when the lot is full?
How does the system know when the lot is full?
Vehicles
Is capacity allocated differently depending on what type of vehicle enters the lot? How so?
Pricing
Are there different rates for different times of day? How will this be handled?
Is there a discount for purchasing a longer total time?

Define a class
Instantiate the class twice, storing each instance in a separate variable.
Print out the two class instances and make sure they are showing the class that you created and two distinct locations in memory.

Define a class
In the class definition, define the __init__, __str__, and __repr__.
Instantiate the class and store the instance in a variable.
Interact with the variable to test that the __str__ and __repr__ methods are working as youâ€™d expect based on your definition.

Open a Python interpreter and complete the following:

Define a class that has a class method that references a class attribute when called.
Do this once using the @classmethod decorator and a second time without using the decorator.
Reflect on which method you prefer and why.
